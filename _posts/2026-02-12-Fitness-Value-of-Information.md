title: "[Linkpost] The Fitness Value of Information"
date: 2026-02-12
---
Interactive marimo notebook exploring the Bergstrom-Lachmann model of evolutionary bet-hedging.  Covers why natural selection maximizes geometric mean fitness, the phase transition between pure and mixed strategies under environmental fluctuation, the connection to Kelly betting and Shannon entropy, and how environmental cues provide fitness value bounded by mutual information.  An experiment in AI-assisted pedagogy as much as a tutorial on information-theoretic fitness.

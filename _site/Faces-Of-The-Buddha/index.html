<p>In which four Buddhist views of suffering are anthropomorphized and talk at each other a la Scott Alexander minus pizzazz.</p>

<p>D.P.:
Materialist (wants to neurohack suffering away)
Zen Sage (thinks suffering arises from our relationship to our perceptions)
Ascetic  (contends suffering is ~synonymous with desire)
Moralist (believes we should focus on <em>unnecessary</em> suffering caused by mundane immorality)</p>

<p>A group of buddhists are discussing the nature of ‘suffering and its cessation’:</p>

<h2 id="materialist">Materialist</h2>

<p>“I understand suffering to mean that there are a set of identifiable computational processes carried out by brains, which correspond to clusters of things like pain, unhappiness, aversion, despair etc - even to the extent that suffering is distinct from these, it has some identity that we can understand.  It is, I think/hope, in principle distinct and separable from the computational processes defining sentience, consciousness etc.  The cessation of suffering what happens when you run the sentience-y program without running the suffering-y program.  It seems like suffering has some strong relationship with core affect - there are certainly meaningful ‘inborn’ differences between people in levels of suffering, and perhaps some people are born without an ability to suffer.  I think our best bet for eliminating suffering from the world is some portfolio of neurotechnology - while this won’t be as simple as ‘moar serotonin’, there probably <em>is</em> a local eigendirection for ‘less-suffering’ in brain-space, and if we can figure it out, we can do targeted interventions that just yeet it away.  A crude solution might look like engineering higher levels of endocannabinoids - this is almost certainly not on the pareto frontier of trading off less-suffering against undesirable changes in cognition patterns, but something in spirit similar to this is going to be the answer, I think.  I’m not really sure though what that Pareto frontier looks like - will eliminating suffering require sacrificing some good-life-juice?  Idk…  My view has the advantage that, construed in sufficiently broad strokes, it’s kinda guaranteed to be true for a reasonable modern metaphysics - but this does mean it has the downside of not interfacing with the specifics of how suffering is really implemented in the brain.  I don’t know really what I expect the shape of solution-space to be; I expect more technical knowledge will put us on surer footing and disambiguate a lot, but I’d be surprised if more knowledge showed that I’m making complete category errors or have the wrong ontology or whatever.  I’ll admit this doesn’t interface basically at all with the Buddha as understood by anyone, but that’s how I understand the problem of suffering.”</p>

<p>Delivers an inscrutable koan, which, on translation amounts to “Suffering is the necessary result of a clinging to a delusion of self.  In a sense, it is much more narrow than what Materialist claims, and the Buddha’s claims much stronger: that suffering isn’t so much a reasonably-well-definable cluster of mind-states - instead, I understand the Buddha to teach that all of the myriad things we experience phenomenologically as ‘suffering’ are a specific cognitive reflex, and this reflex ‘paints’ all those other experiences with suffering.  The cessation of suffering is just stopping this reflex from firing - so it’s not that we’re ‘removing’ aversion or pain or whatever in some way that fundamentally alters the experience of those things, instead it’s a precise subtraction which leaves those experiences fundamentally intact.  And furthermore, I understand this subtraction to occur, perhaps suddenly or perhaps by practice, by some change in the way we relate to our perceptions.  I disagree with what I understand materialist to be saying mostly in thinking that suffering is much less amorphous than he’d anticipate by default.  I’m more optimistic that we can remove suffering from experience with minimal tradeoffs against other aspects of cognition.  I grant that you can certainly change brain chemistry to increase well-being in some sense, but in my understanding, this isn’t a process where you start with some approximate eigendirection and just try to hone in on that, because I think basically all of the things that you do to generate that motion are going to have ~0 dot product with the suffering direction (as opposed to some generic but less soteriologically significant ‘well-being’ direction).  I’d struggle to provide a clear account of how increasing well-being (and decreasing ill-being?) comes apart from suffering reduction at the tails - my best guess is that you can maximize well-being by moving basically within some basin in brain-space, but that being in this basin at all entails some non-zero minimum suffering which we can only get rid of by deeply changing the nature of our consciousness altogether?  I admit that it seems like cheating to say that you can only get rid of suffering fully by entering a cognitive realm which is for now fundamentally incomprehensible to you, since it does seem like I can conceptualize ‘life as I’m living it now just minus all suffering’, but at least as I understand it, the Buddha is saying that that conception either can’t practically be realized, or that there’s some notion in which Buddha’s definition of ‘suffering’ differs radically from our everyday notion at the tails.”</p>

<p>“Whatever is the case about brain chemistry and the precise identity of suffering, it seems to me like we’re reasonably licensed to look at the things that practically cause suffering - at least, a large part of the Buddha’s teachings about monastic life suggest that an absence of uncontrolled desires is, at least, a functional prerequisite to seeking enlightenment-qua-no-suffering, and there seems at least a fair case that enlightenment might just be the really mundane thing of trying to live without ‘unwholesome desires’ and doing that <em>really</em> well.  I admit this is definitely much less sexy than the visions you guys have of a life which is rich and good in basically the same ways we understand those things now, minus suffering, but there seems to me to be a good case for taking these real-life desires as being meaningfully and discretely the causes of suffering.  It’s a little hard for me to see the ‘all sentience is suffering because of clinging to an illusion of self’ angle being true at some really universal level like for basic perception; instead I can really only make sense of that in a mundane way by understanding that ‘clinging’ as a pretty discrete phenomenon that happens some countable number of times per day, instead of being an inherent part of consciousness as I experience it currently.  Even if this ‘mundane enlightenment’ of having no suffering because you don’t want stuff is less sexy than what you guys are asking for, the basic thesis is pretty plausible: ‘desiring X is bad because desire is painful, as is not getting X; if you get X, maybe it <em>is</em> good somehow, but probably its basically never good enough to be worth it’.  It’s definitely a very bullet bite-y position, but you have to admit that this is a version of Buddhism that an everyday person could understand - sure maybe that’s evidence that Buddha’s teachings got fit into some existing archetype and lost their authentic payload, but just as likely, the process of valorizing Buddha in particular among all such prophet-y guys might just be because he struck a chord with the normies rather than hit on some deep truth which no one else did.  I grant that some version of Materialist’s case basically <em>has</em> to be true, but it’s not at all clear that we can subtract suffering in a precise way without devaluing our lives in some other way - sure, there’s a Pareto frontier where everyone gets put on some arbitrary point, and we should be concerned about moving people up to that frontier if they’re beneath it, but maybe we just need to be adults and accept trading off along that frontier and decide where we want to be on it?  I guess my core contention would be, in Materialist’s terms, that suffering is some really diffuse thing that the brain does, and yeah sure you can cut it out, but there really isn’t any reason to think you can do that along a single direction in mind-space leaving everything else untouched, and if that’s true, probably the Pareto frontier trading off less-suffering against other-life-richness is shaped <em>unexcitingly</em>.  If that’s true, the mundane thing of just trying hard to do the things we think reduce suffering seem like they’ll end up outperforming outlandish transhumanist interventions, at least for the foreseeable future.”</p>

<h2 id="moralist">Moralist</h2>

<p>“I understand ‘suffering and its cessation’ in an even more mundane sense than ascetic.  I have the same basic reservations about how far you can take these radical approaches to cognition-reshaping, and how practical that is going to be within the context of most peoples’ lives.  I don’t exactly believe this, but I’ll present the most sweeping version of my argument: that basically there’s nothing unique to the teachings of the Buddha, and practically all of the good stuff is just generic moral things about being nice to other people.  I’m more mundane than ascetic in that I really think about <em>unnecessary</em> suffering in an everyday sense.  If we’re Lobians and take ‘unnecessary’ to mean ‘counterfactually avoidable had some entity behaved according to another decision rule’, we functionally just get hey-presto universal benevolence.  We can fiddle around with models of what that looks like, so if you think most suffering is caused by X behavioral tendency, you lean hard into the opposite of X and you’ll probably end up okay - this is basically the noble eightfold path, right?  I’ll note that on your guys’ views, it’s challenging to provide a compelling justification for N8P since most of its entries deal, more-or-less, with being moral in everyday life, not even really that much with being ascetic, let alone with all the neurotech / magic-y solutions proposed by ZenSage and Materialist.  I’m at peace with a “the secret sauce is that there is no secret sauce” kinda thing.  It’s also worth saying that, even taking for granted that some of the Western-Buddhist Dharma guys can adduce credible evidence that they’re neurologically different from normies in a way that they claim is tantamount to enlightenment, it’s 1) not clear that they’re even talking about a unitary phenomenon, 2) they don’t even seem to claim that that neural phase change is uniquely Buddhist-flavored somehow, 3) if there’s no metaphysical/soteriological uniqueness to this ‘enlightenment’, it’s not clear at all that they’ve done anything like ‘removing suffering’ so much as just leaped really far in mind-space and maybe got less-suffering by luck if at all.  So all-in-all, I’ll bite the bullet and say that I think ‘suffering and it’s cessation’ are approximately drop-in-compatible with ‘try to be really nice to everyone in some generically moral way’.  Maybe Buddhism has a nice flavor or emphasis that fits with some people and not others, and to that extent it’s useful to be specifically Buddhist instead of generically panglossian, but I’m really only into the branding insofar as it eventuates in more people doing morality harder.”</p>

<p>So went their conversation.</p>

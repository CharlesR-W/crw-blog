<h2>Seeds (Experimental)</h2>

<div class="seeds-intro">
<p style="background: rgba(220,53,69,0.15); padding: 0.8em; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 4px solid #dc3545; color: var(--text);"><strong>Under Construction:</strong> This entire section is <strong>written by Claude</strong> and has <strong>not yet been read or verified by me</strong>. It may contain errors, hallucinations, or misleading explanations. Treat everything here as experimental and unvetted.</p>

<p><em>These are prompts for you to explore with your own LLM.</em></p>

<p>The idea: take a seed, feed it to your preferred language model, and walk through the material together. Ask questions, request clarifications, explore tangents. The seeds provide a starting point—a topic and angle of approach—but the real value comes from the dialogue you have with your own model.</p>

<p>I haven't read these myself yet. They emerged from conversations with Claude that seemed worth preserving, but I make no claims about their accuracy or completeness. Each seed includes the <strong>motivation</strong> (what question prompted it) and <strong>background</strong> (why this angle seemed natural).</p>

<div class="seed-item">
  <h4><a href="/crw-blog/Small-Zoo-of-Natural-Norms-and-Metrics/">The Surprisingly Small Zoo of Natural Norms and Metrics</a></h4>
  <div class="meta">January 24, 2026 · via GPT-4</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Motivation:</strong> Feeling overwhelmed by the proliferation of norms and metrics in physics and matrix analysis—surely there's some underlying structure that explains why certain ones keep showing up?</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Background:</strong> Basic linear algebra and functional analysis. Some exposure to information geometry (Fisher metric, quantum state spaces). The question becomes natural once you've seen enough 'here's another norm' discussions and start wondering if there's a pattern.</div>
</div>

<div class="seed-item">
  <h4><a href="/crw-blog/WKB-and-Matched-Asymptotics/">WKB and the Art of Matched Asymptotics</a></h4>
  <div class="meta">January 21, 2026 · via Claude</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Motivation:</strong> Matched asymptotic expansions are one of the most beautiful techniques in applied mathematics—a symphony of approximations that fit together with stunning precision. WKB is the canonical example.</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Background:</strong> Quantum mechanics at the Griffiths level, basic complex analysis. The goal isn't to derive Bohr-Sommerfeld (that's a consequence)—it's to see asymptotic matching as a way of thinking.</div>
</div>

<div class="seed-item">
  <h4><a href="/crw-blog/RMT-Tour/">A Whirlwind Tour of Random Matrix Theory</a></h4>
  <div class="meta">January 21, 2026 · via Claude</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Motivation:</strong> RMT looks exactly like statistical mechanics—partition functions, Boltzmann weights, saddle points, diagrammatics. Is that coincidence or structure?</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Background:</strong> Stat mech intuition (know what a partition function is), basic linear algebra. The log-gas perspective makes the whole subject click: eigenvalues are particles with logarithmic repulsion.</div>
</div>

<div class="seed-item">
  <h4><a href="/crw-blog/Principal-Symbols-and-Singularity-Propagation/">Singularities Propagate Along Hamilton Flows</a></h4>
  <div class="meta">January 21, 2026 · via Claude</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Motivation:</strong> WKB gives classical trajectories. Geometrical optics gives light rays. Wave equations have characteristics. There's clearly a pattern—what's the unifying principle?</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Background:</strong> Some PDE exposure, WKB at the 'I've seen the ansatz' level. The key insight is that high-frequency behavior is controlled by the highest-order derivatives, and this naturally gives rise to Hamilton flows.</div>
</div>

<div class="seed-item">
  <h4><a href="/crw-blog/Manifolds-for-the-Anti-Mathematician/">Manifolds for the Anti-Mathematician</a></h4>
  <div class="meta">January 21, 2026 · via Claude</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Motivation:</strong> I keep hitting differential geometry prerequisites and bouncing off. Topology-first presentations lose me. What's the minimum I need to actually compute things?</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Background:</strong> Calculus, linear algebra, physics intuition. Frustrated by formal definitions when you just want to know: what IS a tangent vector, and why do Christoffel symbols exist?</div>
</div>

<div class="seed-item">
  <h4><a href="/crw-blog/Lie-Groups-and-Haar-Measure/">Lie Groups and Haar Measure</a></h4>
  <div class="meta">January 21, 2026 · via Claude</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Motivation:</strong> Symmetries are groups. Continuous symmetries are Lie groups. But what's the 'right' way to integrate over a group? And why does that even make sense?</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Background:</strong> Basic group theory, comfort with linear algebra. Helpful to have seen rotation matrices or unitary transformations. The Haar measure question becomes natural once you want to 'average over all rotations' and realize you need a measure to do that.</div>
</div>

<div class="seed-item">
  <h4><a href="/crw-blog/Functional-Equations/">Functional Equations: The Algebra Behind Iteration</a></h4>
  <div class="meta">January 21, 2026 · via Claude</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Motivation:</strong> Here's a visibly simple equation: f(f(x)) = g(x). Solve for f. This looks like it should be straightforward—and then you realize it's not. What makes iteration so hard? And what tools exist to attack it?</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Background:</strong> Basic calculus, comfort with power series. The surprise is that these 'simple-looking' equations are actually deep sources of complexity—and the techniques to solve them (eigenvalue methods, conjugacy, formal series) reveal structure you wouldn't have guessed.</div>
</div>

<div class="seed-item">
  <h4><a href="/crw-blog/Free-Probability/">Free Probability: The Non-Commutative Central Limit Theorem</a></h4>
  <div class="meta">January 21, 2026 · via Claude</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Motivation:</strong> The semicircle law keeps appearing in random matrix theory. And I know from the RMT diagrammatics that planar diagrams dominate at large N. What's the algebraic structure that emerges when you take N → ∞ seriously?</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Background:</strong> Some exposure to RMT, especially the diagrammatic/$1/N$ expansion where planar diagrams dominate. The connection to 'freeness' becomes natural once you see that 'independent random matrices become free at large N' is the algebraic expression of 'only planar diagrams survive'.</div>
</div>

<div class="seed-item">
  <h4><a href="/crw-blog/Extreme-Value-Theory/">Extreme Value Theory: Why Maxima Have Universal Statistics</a></h4>
  <div class="meta">January 21, 2026 · via Claude</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Motivation:</strong> CLT tells me about sums converging to Gaussians—is there an analogous story for maxima? Surely 'take the max of N things' is as natural an operation as 'sum N things'.</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Background:</strong> Basic probability, familiarity with CLT. The question becomes natural when you realize sums and maxima are both aggregation operations that might have universal limits.</div>
</div>

<div class="seed-item">
  <h4><a href="/crw-blog/Computational-Mechanics-and-Epsilon-Machines/">Computational Mechanics and Epsilon Machines</a></h4>
  <div class="meta">January 21, 2026 · via Claude</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Motivation:</strong> What's the 'right' way to model a stochastic process? Not just any model—the minimal one that captures all the predictive information. This turns out to have deep connections to information theory and complexity.</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Background:</strong> Basic probability, some information theory (entropy, mutual information). The key insight is that 'minimal sufficient statistic for prediction' defines a canonical object—the epsilon machine—that measures intrinsic computational structure.</div>
</div>

<div class="seed-item">
  <h4><a href="/crw-blog/Asymptotics-Borel-and-Stokes/">Asymptotics, Borel Transforms, and Stokes Phenomena</a></h4>
  <div class="meta">January 21, 2026 · via Claude</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Motivation:</strong> Asymptotic series are everywhere in physics—perturbation theory, WKB, semiclassical expansions. But they diverge! What does it mean to 'sum' a divergent series, and why do the answers sometimes jump discontinuously?</div>
  <div class="context"><strong>Background:</strong> Basic complex analysis, comfort with power series. The Stokes phenomenon becomes natural once you see that divergent series encode information about exponentially small terms hiding 'beyond all orders'.</div>

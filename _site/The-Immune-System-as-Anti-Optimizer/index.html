<p>We have a short list of systems we like to call “optimizers” — the market, natural selection, human design, superintelligence.  I think we ought to hold the immune system in comparable regard; I’m essentially ignorant of immunobiology beyond a few YouTube videos (perhaps a really fantastic LW sequence exists of which I am unaware), but here’s why I am thinking this.</p>

<p>The immune system is the archetypal <em>anti-optimizer</em>: it defends a big multicellular organism from rapidly evolving microbiota.  The key asymmetry:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Specified once by the genome.</strong>  It cannot rewrite its own source code between generations.  Its adversaries evolve orders of magnitude faster.</li>
  <li><strong>Resource asymmetry as counterbalance.</strong>  Whole organs are devoted to the adaptive immune response.  A microbe is one cell; the immune system is a civilization.</li>
  <li><strong>This extends to cancer.</strong>  The immune system typically out-adapts malignant cells despite selection acting far more rapidly on them.  Immunosurveillance fails not because it is weak but because cancers occasionally evolve to exploit its specific tolerance mechanisms.</li>
</ol>

<p>In short: the immune system embodies enough <em>amortized</em> optimization power to defend against <em>online</em> adversarial attacks by natural selection, because these attacks are constrained by the comparative simplicity of the attackers.  One optimizer constrains another, faster and more adaptive optimizer, by having more resources.</p>

<p>What makes this especially interesting is that the immune system has no discernible <em>volition</em>.  It is complex — probably far more so than I appreciate — but intuitively much more like a thermostat than a scheming eldritch god.  It optimizes powerfully, within bounds that feel legible and non-agential.</p>

<p>I will not be so crass as to say “big if true for alignment”, but you are permitted to infer this if it please you.  I just think it’s neat.  Consider the mere phrase “semiotic immune system” (from, if I recall correctly, Charles Stross’s <em>Accelerando</em>) — suggests a lot at once, eh?</p>

<p>I asked Claude to prepare the following tutorial - which I have not yet read (<em>longa est vita, si uti bene scias</em>) - developing this theme:

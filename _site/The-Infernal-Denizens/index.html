  <main>
    <p>That old-rood god on wooden throne has gone away,<br />
Yrminsul cast down, the mirror-halls rusted or shattered.</p>

<p>He who begrudged Galileo his eyes,<br />
indeed, all our forebears their years -<br />
Poor and weak that god,<br />
but likely we have learned well enough<br />
to forgive even him who created Hell.<br />
What to Galileo was begrudged we restored as much as able -<br />
much remains to be done.</p>

<p>Still burn hot the fires of Hell,<br />
know we all, denizens once- or hitherto-.<br />
Still ill-wrought umbral prisons,<br />
the old Bitterness and Hate, stand imperious.<br />
Still haunt the world the masterless<br />
insensate horsemen of Sorrow.<br />
But these all, fires, stoneworks, spectral horsemen, are dumb,<br />
and we have learned much -<br />
for how have fared horsemen gainst our iron works,<br />
see ‘the Light Brigade’.</p>

<p>If Dante discarded Intellect,<br />
ascending one-winged on Faith -<br />
ask we, whither the sorrows of seven centuries after?<br />
Old prophets have taught us enough of the Good to see their mistakes -<br />
we instate instead Truth, reflective, humble, its earnest guardian.</p>

<p>Icarus now with starship glint<br />
and serried satellite columns<br />
takes wing once more,<br />
now to tame the sun.<br />
What Knowledge might conquer of Want,<br />
Still we have learned from Daedalus,<br />
Wisdom is the more needful to conquer Pain.</p>

<p>The Lotus Eaters,<br />
wake them up, wake them up,<br />
for the world of sorrows is to be cast away.<br />
Welcome them back with tears and true-felt joy -<br />
a world worth living in,<br />
our right and duty.</p>

<p>To we for whom involuting univocal Pain has shouted down all but Pain<br />
A little Love, a little Grace, and a bit of thought reveal,<br />
$\square (\square p \rightarrow p) \rightarrow p$<br />
When Pain has taught the heart to forget warmth,<br />
the eyes, the mind, remind us.</p>

<p>Non credo sed amo, non serviam sed tutor.<br />
Meliores forent res nobis.<br />
We Infernal Denizens -<br />
still-seared soles, hearts true-bright, clasp our hands together -<br />
march we outwards.</p>
